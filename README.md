# What Makes an effective programmer?

What do the best programmers do that the average programmers don't?

Do they write more code faster?

Can we say that because one person A wrote 10,000 lines and person B wrote 500
that A is outperforming B? No we can't. In the world of software development
500 lines of code can do the work of 10,000 and it's much easier to work on the
500 lines than 10,000.

Do they get code to pass tests more quickly?

Sure that will happen, but since programmers write the tests _as well_, their
implementation code, the code that satisfies the test, can only test what they
themselves know about. A bad programmer will write low-value tests, pass it
with low-value code, and sleep soundly not knowing how blind they were. The
measure of code is not passing tests someone already wrote. If that were the
case, we could never make anything new since to make something new is to make
something whose behavior we don't know well enough to describe in rigorous
test-language.

The difference is _process_.

**Effective programmers take the time to _really_ understand the problem
they're trying to solve. Once they understand it, they make focused, decided
steps with _mindfulness_ to implement the solution. Learning to program is the
art of solving problems. It's the main muscle that you are constantly
developing.**

Let's delve in a bit deeper here - what is problem-solving?

## Problem-Solving in the Abstract

In soccer, getting past the defense to score a goal is a problem, there are
antagonistic people in the way of the ball getting into the net. Making a
peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a problem, you need the ingredients, you
need to arrange them in the right order, you might need to cut off the bread
crust. Whether we call it a "play" on the soccer field or a "recipe" in the
kitchen - essentially what you're doing is following a process to create
_another_ process &mdash; a process that will solve the problem.

Good programmers do this every time they start on a new bit of work. From adding
a tiny new feature to undertaking a revolutionary project. Their process
typically looks like:

- What is the problem I'm trying to solve?
- What does the output look like? What is the end result I'm trying to build?
- What inputs do I need in order to create that output?
- What do I have now? What is missing?

### How Do We Develop the Problem-Solving Muscle?

You build the problem-solving skill the same you build every skill: constant,
_conscious_ effort and practice. The great thing about learning to program is
that you have constant access to problems that help build this skill. Every lab
and every real-world observation is an opportunity to practice and get better.

Treat them that way ;-)
